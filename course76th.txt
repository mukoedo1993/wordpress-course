Quick Note About The Next Lesson
In the next lesson you’ll notice the old WordPress edit-post screen because that portion of the video was filmed before the modern editor was released. 
However, by the end of the lesson we remove “editor” from the “supports” array for the Programs post type, and when WordPress doesn’t see ‘editor’ supported
for a post type it
will fallback to the classic edit screen anyways. Essentially, if your edit-post screen doesn't look exactly like mine for the entirety of the video
it's not an issue. Thanks!
