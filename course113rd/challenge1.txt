You must be a web developer to change the slideshow. But it would be nice if anyone on
our team or at our company could update the slideshow. You shouldn't need to be a web developer to
change the text orto make button point to a new page or to upload a new photograph.

First chanllege, make the slideshow editable from within the WP admin dashboard.

Option 1: create a new custom post type. custom fields: slide title, slide subtitle, slide link text and slide link value and slide photograph. In this strategy, each slide will be its own post. 

Option 2: rely on a page instead of a custom post type. (Not possible, because it requires costly ACF pro plugin, 49usd a year!)

Soln:
Ref.: Malinovic (step 1 to step 4)
1. register a new custom post type. see mu-plugin folder. (Notice that we also have to set capability properly so the plugin roles could deal with this custom post correctly.)
2. DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE PERMALINK SYSTEM
3. Use ACF to create a new field system. Here, See the icon custom-field.
4. See front-page.php file. Replace the slide part with current code.
5. Grant permission of all operations on slides to the new role, designer.
