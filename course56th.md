# Quick Note About The Next Lesson
In the next lesson you’ll see me use jQuery. <br>
jQuery is not my first choice in 2021, <br>
but I don’t believe it makes sense to completely re-film the entire JavaScript portion of this course for very minimal changes. <br>
I encourage you to follow along with these lessons and use jQuery where I do as well, <br>
but rest assured that after we complete each JavaScript feature in the course, <br>
there is a newly added video lesson (filmed in June of 2020) where I walk you through the birds-eye-view of how I’d write the same feature without jQuery. <br>
In those video lessons you’ll also find a downloadable resource file with my plain JS source code that you’re free to drop into your project as a replacement for<br>
the jQuery powered module.<br>
For example, with regards to our search feature, at the very end of this chapter you’ll find a new video lesson providing the jQuery-free solution for the search <br>
feature.<br>

Thanks,<br>
