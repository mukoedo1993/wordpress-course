# Quick Note About The Next Lesson
In the following lesson you’ll see me visit URLs of `localhost:3000` in the address bar to view my website. You<br> can ignore that part of my URL, I want you to continue to use<br> the same local domain you’ve been using throughout the<br> course, most likely, `fictional-university.local`

For example in the following lesson when you see me visit this URL:
`localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`

You would visit:
`fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`

This is also true of the JavaScript code we write.<br> When we include a URL in our JS code you can actually remove the base part of your domain entirely,<br> and just begin the URL with a slash character, like this:

`$.getJSON("/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?search…`

If your code isn’t working I always recommend downloading the zip resource for the lesson and comparing your code with mine.<br> I’ve updated all zip files in the course as of July 2021.
