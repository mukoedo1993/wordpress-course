# Important Note About The Next Lesson
If you've been able to follow along successfully with the course up to this point you can safely skip the next video lesson and<br>
also skip the remainder of this text article.<br>

In the next lesson we learn how to "import" an existing or "finished" WordPress site into your local dev environment.<br>
Please note, in the video lesson I explain that you only want to do this in a new empty WordPress installation as it <br>
will overwrite your current WordPress site/domain/project. So you'd want to create a new separate empty WordPress installation <br>
if you don't want to lose progress on your existing site. A few students have missed this warning and overwritten the progress they <br>
had made up until this point in the course and I don't want to see anyone else experience that frustration, hence this note.<br>

Also, once you actually begin importing the file it will take a couple of minutes instead of the couple seconds shown in the video (for brevity). <br>
The import process takes a minute or two because it is importing 200,000 example pet records in the database (for the plugin development MySQL lessons).<br>

That's it, thanks!<br>
