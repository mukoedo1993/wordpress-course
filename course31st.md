# A Note About the WordPress Post Edit Screen
As of July 2021 I’ve updated all previous lesson videos to show the new modern WP block editor when showing you how to find a new feature such as category, excerpt, custom fields, etc… however, for the remainder of the course, I will not be re-filming all Post edit screen footage. Rest assured that as of July 2021 I’ve tested our course project with the newest version of WordPress and our solutions work perfectly with the modern WP Editor. Big picture, if your post edit screen looks different than mine in upcoming video lessons; it’s nothing to worry about!

Also, towards the end of the course you'll find an entire chapter about developing plugins and new custom block types for the modern block editor!
